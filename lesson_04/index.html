			<h1>Whittier
				<br>the only city on Earth where the entire population lives in one
				house</h1>
			<img src="img/whittier_3.jpg" alt="City of Whittier">

			<h2>The Beauty of Whittier</h2>
			<p>1 -- Whittier is surrounded by mountains, waterfalls, and water. Its
				subarctic climate makes it the wettest city in the United States, with an
				annual rainfall of 5,024 mm and winds of up to 100 km/h. 51 sq. km is the
				area of ​​this Alaskan city. It has a population of 214, most of whom live
				in the same house.
				We are amazed by the history of the city at the end of the world, and we are
				eager to tell it to you.
				<br> Недалеко від міста розташований льодовик, який у 1915 році назвали
				на честь поета Джона Грінліф Віттіер (John Greenleaf Whittier).
				Ми вражені історією міста на краю світу, і нам кортить розповісти її
				вам.</p>

			<div class="starting">2 -- During World War II, this area was chosen to
				organize an ice-free port and military garrison. Whittier was located at
				some distance from other settlements and transport
				infrastructure, so a tunnel had to be built.
				The military facility, port, and railroad formed Camp Sullivan in 1943,
				which was used until 1960.
			</div>

			<p class="decor">3 -- During the Cold War, housing and recreation areas for
				1,000 people were built here. In the 1950s, 2 buildings appeared. The first,
				the Buckner Building, is now in disrepair, and the second, the Begich
				Towers, is still in use today. Both structures were to become part of a
				large military complex, and it was planned to build 8 more similar
				structures for the needs of the army.</p>

			<p class="decor-one">4 -- A turning point in the city's history was March 27,
				1964 when the Great Alaskan Earthquake occurred. Its magnitude is estimated
				at
				9.2 points, the tremors caused a tsunami. The waves then reached 13 meters
				and severely damaged the city: several buildings on the waterfront were
				destroyed.</p>

			<p class="decor-two">5 -- The 14-story building was built in 1957 and was
				originally named for Colonel William Walter Hodge, who commanded the 93rd
				Engineer Regiment on the Alaska Highway. In 1972, the Begich Towers received
				their current name in honor of Democratic Congressman Nick Begich, a
				representative from Alaska. The only building in Whittier
				has 14 floors and 3 modules, which are interconnected by numerous
				corridors, elevators and stairs. The building has a flat roof and a
				rectangular shape.
				Where does the word “tower” come from in the name, and even in the plural?
				The fact is that on the
				north side there are 2 protruding modules that resemble towers.
			</p>
			<img src="img/whittier_1.jpg" alt="City in the mountains">

			<p class="decor-line">6 -- There are just over 200 people living in Begić
				Towers, and
				the children enter school through a tunnel due to the harsh weather
				conditions.
				<br>That's the entire population of the town. In addition to the apartments,
				the building houses
				a post office, a Methodist church, several shops, a laundry, a police
				station,
				the city hall, a hospital, and even a small hotel. There are 2 playgrounds
				in Whittier:
				one of them is open only in the summer, and the second is under a roof -
				weather
				conditions do not always allow young citizens to walk safely outside.
				On bad days, they go to school through a special tunnel. </p>

			<p class="decor-line-one">7 -- There is no usual division between home and
				school:
				children and teachers perceive each other as good neighbors or friends, so
				there is no need to impose discipline. To stay healthy, Whittier residents
				go to the school gym, which is open during school hours, but there is no
				traditional fitness center. Boats can be seen in the parking lot next to the
				cars.</p>
			<img src="img/whittier_2.jpg" alt="A city in one house">
			<div class="font-default">
				8 -- <span class="tunnel">The only way to get to Whittier by land is through
					a tunnel.</span> <br>
				The path is blocked by a mountain range, and residents and visitors can
				travel by plane, boat, train, or car. The latter travel through a tunnel
				through Mount Maynard. A single-lane road runs through the tunnel, both for
				cars and trains. A round trip costs $13, while locals use an annual pass
				worth $500.
			</div>

			<p class="local-fonts">9 -- There is a schedule near the tunnel: 15 minutes
				it allows traffic in one direction, the next 15 minutes - in the other. At
				night, the road is closed. Locals sometimes go to Anchorage, located about
				an hour away. However, if you do not have time to return by 10:30 PM, you
				will have to spend the night in the car.
			</p>
			<p class="letter-capital"> 10 -- Whittier seems like a forgotten city, but
				tourists come here. After all, cruises start from the port: those who wish
				can see icebergs and polar bears. Therefore, you can periodically see liners
				here. The city itself is also of interest - hotel rooms are booked in
				advance. Locals are engaged in fishing, work in the port, or are associated
				with tourism.</p>
